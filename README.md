Project Overview

Itâ€™s a simple Java demo project created to test building with Maven.

The project only has one class: HelloWorld.java.

Its purpose is mainly educational â€” to show how to structure a Maven-based Java project, compile it, and run it.

What pom.xml Does

Defines the projectâ€™s metadata (name, version, group ID).

Tells Maven it should package this as a JAR file.

Uses the exec-maven-plugin to allow running the app with mvn exec:java.
